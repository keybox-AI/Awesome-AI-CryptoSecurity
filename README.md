  **Authors:** Isaac David, Liyi Zhou, Kaihua Qin, Dawn Song, Lorenzo Cavallaro, Arthur Gervais  
  **Year:** 2023  
  **Summary:** Explores LLMs in DeFi smart contract security, highlighting their potential and limitations, and emphasizing the need for manual audits.

- **[Large Language Model-Powered Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection: New Perspectives](2310.01152.pdf)**  
  **Authors:** Sihao Hu, Tiansheng Huang, Fatih Ä°lhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu  
  **Year:** 2023  
  **Summary:** Introduces GPTLens, an adversarial framework for smart contract vulnerability detection using LLMs, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.  
  **Code:** [GitHub - GPTLens](https://github.com/git-disl/GPTLens)

- **[Blockchain Large Language Models - BlockGPT](2304.12749.pdf)**
  **Authors:** Yu Gai, Liyi Zhou, Kaihua Qin, Dawn Song, Arthur Gervais
  **Year:** 2023
  **Summary:** Presents BlockGPT, leveraging large language models for detecting anomalies in blockchain transactions in real-time. It advances beyond conventional methods by eschewing fixed patterns, demonstrated through its application to Ethereum transactions. Innovations include specialized data encoding, domain-specific tokenization, and a tree encoding technique for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) traces.
